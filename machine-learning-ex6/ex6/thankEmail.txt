Dear Fred and Sylvia:

On behalf of the entire Marsden family I would like to thank you for your unflagging support and kind condolences in recent weeks as we mourned the tragic loss of Raymond. 

Without wonderful friends like you to spend time with us and help with daily tasks it would have been much more difficult for us to suffer through this very difficult period. I especially appreciated the numerous meals that you prepared and delivered to us as well as the drives to school you provided for Kirstin and Charlie. You can't imagine what a help this was to Carl and I as we tried to focus on Raymond's funeral arrangements while also having to deal with the media. 

As you will understand, it is going to take some time before our family can get back to normal after this senseless tragedy. So, please don't take our lack of contact during this period as any more than us taking the time we need to try to get back to some semblance of a normal life. 

Please accept our heartfelt thanks for all that you have done. 

Sincerely grateful,


Susan and Carl
